## **Is Stake.us Real Money?**

Stake.us operates under a **sweepstakes model**, meaning it does not offer traditional real-money gambling. Instead, it uses **Stake Cash (SC)** and **Gold Coins (GC)**. Stake Cash can be redeemed for real prizes, including gift cards or other cash-equivalent rewards, once you meet the redemption requirements. So yes, it’s not “real money gambling” in a casino sense, but you can still win actual value.

## **Explanation of Stake Cash & Gold Coins**

*   **Stake Cash (SC):** Premium currency that can be used on all games and redeemed for real prizes.
*   **Gold Coins (GC):** Play-for-fun currency that lets you explore games without financial commitment.

You earn SC through promo codes, bonuses, and events. GC is generally handed out more frequently and used for casual gameplay.
